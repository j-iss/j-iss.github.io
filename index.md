I am currently part of the Advanced Research Team at Samsung Research, where I am working on research at the intersection of deep learning and graph theory.

I recently completed my DPhil (PhD) in Computer Science at the University of Oxford in 2022, where I was supervised by Leslie Ann Goldberg and Andreas Galanis in the Algorithms and Complexity group. My PhD research was in the area of randomised algorithms for approximate counting and sampling.

I obtained my Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Imperial College London, in 2017.
