I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, where I am supervised by Leslie Ann Goldberg and Andreas Galanis.

I am broadly interested in algorithms and complexity. So far, most of my research has focussed on the design and analysis of randomised algorithms for approximate counting. 

I expect to graduate in the summer of 2022, and am currently looking for postdoctoral research opportunities.

My CV can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/cv.pdf).
