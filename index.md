I recently obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oxford where I worked on randomised algorithms for approximate counting, within the Algorithms and Complexity group. I am currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon.

My research background is in theoretical computer science and the design and analysis of algorithms; for example, my PhD research concerned randomised approximation algorithms for counting and sampling combinatorial structures in graphs, leveraging tools from areas such as graph theory, discrete mathematics, and probability theory. Prior to my PhD, I worked full-time as a C++ Software Engineer at Amadeus, and I obtained my Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Imperial College London, in 2017.
